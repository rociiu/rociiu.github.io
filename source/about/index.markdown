I'm Roc Yu who build web applications using ruby on rails for serval years. As a contractor I worked for different kinds of clients include large enterprise and startups. I can build web applications from backend(ruby/rails) to frontend (jquery, backbonejs, angularjs, sass) and data visualizations(highchart, d3js). Got a cool idea? Please contact <a href="mailto:rociiu.yu@gmail.com">me</a>
